## About

Every football team whether at a club level or international level needs to work efficiently to improve their game and entertain their supporters. As an aspiring Data Scientist, it's now your responsibility to bring in quality data, understand and analyze and try to apply the same to the FIFA dataset.

The football clubs look to gain a competitive edge on and off the pitch, and big data is allowing them to extract insights to improve player performance, prevent injuries and increase their commercial efficiency. The utilization of data in football (or soccer) has become very important to develop player skills or match analysis. The main objective of this hackathon is to evaluate the player’s commercial value, based on their skill-set and performance history.

The dataset provided is extracted from EA’s FIFA 18-20 game, 70% of the data will be used as training data, and the rest 30% will be used as test data. The targeted field is “value” for the training set, and you are required to predict the most valued player from a given lineup of custom-team, which contains the player's FIFA id.

The notebook provides our solution to Hackathon 2022 hosted by IIT Madras. We achieved a rank of 22 out 69 participants.
